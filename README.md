## Development
In a single-user-environment like jupyterlab, please set authorship per commit:
```
export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="YourGitUserName" && export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="YourGitAccountEmail" && export GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME" && export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL" && git commit -m "my commit msg"
```
e.g.
```
git add README.md
export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="SimonStier" && export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="simon.stier@isc.fraunhofer.de" && export GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME" && export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL" && git commit -m "add readme"
git push origin main
```

If there are more than one author, they can be listed as co-authors in the commit msg (press 'Enter' to enter a linebreak, 'Enter' after the final '"' will mark the end of the multiline commit msg):
```
"your commit msg

Co-authored-by: YourCoAuthor <YourCoAuthor@users.noreply.github.com>"
```
e.g.
```
"add results from hackathon
